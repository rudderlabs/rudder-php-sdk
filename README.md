# What is RudderStack?

[RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/) is a **customer data pipeline** tool for collecting, routing and processing data
from your websites, apps, cloud tools, and data warehouse.

More information on RudderStack can be found [here](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server).

## Getting Started with PHP SDK

Install `rudder-php-sdk` using `composer`
```
git clone https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-php-sdk /my/app/folders/
```

## Initialize the ```Client```

```
use Rudder\Rudder;

require_once realpath(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

Rudder::init(WRITE_KEY, array(
  "data_plane_url" => DATA_PLANE_URL,
  "consumer"       => "lib_curl",
  "debug"          => true,
  "max_queue_size" => 10000,
  "flush_at"     => 100
));
```

## SDK Initialization options

Below parameters are optional and can be passed during SDK initialization.

| `consumer`              | String   | `lib_curl`                      | To explicitly mark which consumer to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
